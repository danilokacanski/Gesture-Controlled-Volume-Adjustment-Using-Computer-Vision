# Gesture-Controlled-Volume-Adjustment-Using-Computer-Vision
A computer vision project that allows users to adjust their PC's volume by tracking the movement and gestures of their thumb and pointer finger.

This computer vision project enables users to control the volume of their PC using simple hand gestures. By tracking the position and distance between the thumb and pointer finger through a webcam, the system detects changes in the hand's configuration and translates this into volume adjustments. The project uses image processing techniques to identify the fingers, and the user can increase or decrease volume in real-time by changing the gap between their thumb and pointer finger.
